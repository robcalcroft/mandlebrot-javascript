# mandlebrot-javascript
Sequential and parallel versions of calcuations in JavaScript

To run, install Node.js and NPM then run `npm install`, you can then use `npm run mandelbrot-sequential` or `npm run mandelbrot-parallel <SIZE> <THREADS>` to run the two calculations. You will need to manually edit the sequential version to modify the run parameters.
